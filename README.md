## POC steps:

1. Watering 1 channel every X hours for Y seconds
2. Watering 2 channels every X hours for Y seconds
3. Measuring in loop and rounding 1 humidity
4. Measuring in loop and rounding 4 humidities
5. Binding 2 humidity sensors to each water pump channels
6. Measuring humidity before watering
7. Setting humidity threshold
8. Watering each channel only if mean one of humidities is below threshold
9. powering sensors only when measuring
